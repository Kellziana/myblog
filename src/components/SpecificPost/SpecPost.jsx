        building user Interfaces and is component-based. I've learned that it's big advantage is that its code fragments are highly reusable 
        as it is quite repetitive. I enjoy coding and creating with this language. I first started to learn about it on an online course, provided by
        Codecademy.com, watched many videos on it, and tried it out myself. It requires quite the knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.</p></div>
